analysis:
  strengths:
    - "Projects section: active projects with FolderKanban icon, color dot, action count badge"
    - "Areas section: areas with emoji icon (or CircleDot fallback), color"
    - "Resources section: collapsed by default, 'View all' link"
    - "Archive section: collapsed by default, 'Browse archive' link"
    - "Collapsible sections with chevron indicators (ChevronDown/ChevronRight)"
    - "[+] button on Projects opens CreateProjectModal"
    - "[+] button on Areas opens CreateAreaModal"
    - "State persistence: bee-sidebar-state key in localStorage"
    - "Default state: projects/areas expanded, resources/archive collapsed"
    - "Empty states: 'No active projects', 'No areas yet'"
    - "CSS truncation via truncate class on labels"
    - "Loading skeletons during fetch"
