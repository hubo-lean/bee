  security: { status: PASS, notes: "Raw SQL uses parameterized queries - no injection risk" }
  performance: { status: PASS, notes: "N+1 eliminated, O(n²) fixed, indexes added, lazy loading implemented" }
  reliability: { status: PASS, notes: "Error handling preserved in optimistic updates" }
  maintainability: { status: PASS, notes: "Code is clean and well-documented with clear dev notes" }

analysis:
  strengths:
    - "N+1 query fix uses raw SQL with proper parameterization for JSON field filtering"
    - "O(n²) sorting replaced with O(1) Map lookup - correct implementation verified in review.ts"
    - "Count queries batched using groupBy - reduces 5 queries to 2"
    - "Optimistic updates include proper rollback on error"
    - "Lazy loading with dynamic imports and loading fallbacks"

  verification:
    - "inbox-queues.service.ts: Raw SQL queries use ${userId} parameterization"
    - "review.ts: Map-based lookup implemented at lines 41-44 and 75-78"
    - "Performance test script included in dev notes"
    - "HNSW index migration file exists"
